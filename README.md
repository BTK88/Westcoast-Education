Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

This command fetches and installs all the dependencies required for the project to run correctly.

### Step 3: Start the Application
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application. To do this, execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npx json-server --watch db.json
```

This command starts a local JSON server and watches for any changes in the `db.json` file, providing a full fake REST API for testing and development purposes.
